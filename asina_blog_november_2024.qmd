@cr-nh-extent-map As darkness extends southward across the Arctic.

[@cr-nh-extent-map]{pan-to="10%,10%" scale-by="2.0"} Sea
ice has advanced to much of the Russian shoreline.

[@cr-nh-extent-map]{pan-to="-10%,-20%" scale-by="2.0"} But growth has
been particularly slow in the Barents and Kara Seas.  The magenta line
shows the 1981 to 2010 average extent for October.

[@cr-nh-extent-map]{pan-to="20%,-20%" scale-by="2.0"} Sea ice is also particularly low in the Beaufort Sea, Baffin Bay, and the Canadian
Archipelago.

@cr-sh-extent-map In the Antarctic, with the onset of spring, the pace of seasonal sea
ice loss has increased.

@cr-nh-ts-october Average Arctic sea ice extent for the month of October was 5.94
million square kilometers (2.29 million square miles), fourth lowest
in the 46-year-satellite record and 610,000 square kilometers (236,000
square miles) higher than 2020, the record low extent for the month

@cr-nh-iqr_timeseries After a slow start early in October, Arctic sea ice extent quickly
grew after mid-October; but, slowed again at the end of the month.

@cr-nh-air-temp During October, much of the Arctic was markedly warmer than
average.

[@cr-nh-air-temp]{pan-to="20%,-10%" scale-by="2.0"} Air temperatures at
the 925 hPa level (approximately 2,500 feet above the surface) were 6
to 10 to degrees Celsius (11 to 18 degrees Fahrenheit) above average
near the pole and north of Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago

@cr-nh-air-temp Much of the rest of the Arctic was at least 2 degrees Celsius (4
degrees Fahrenheit) above average

[@cr-nh-air-temp]{pan-to="20%,-25%" scale-by="2.0"} The exception to
this warmer Arctic, were the coastal areas of the Chukchi, East
Siberian, and Laptev Seas, where average temperatures prevailed.

@cr-nh-slp Sea level pressure was low over most of the Arctic during October.

[@cr-nh-slp]{pan-to="-20%,-50%" scale-by="1.5"} Distinct lows were centered over the Gulf of Alaska,

[@cr-nh-slp]{pan-to="-25%,0%" scale-by="1.5"} the Canadian Archipelago,

[@cr-nh-slp]{pan-to="5%,20%" scale-by="1.5"} and Svalbard.

@cr-nh-slp This pressure pattern helped to push ice northwards in the Kara and
Barents Seas and bring in warmer air towards the central Arctic Ocean.

@cr-nh-ts-october Including 2024, the downward linear trend in Arctic sea ice extent for
October is 79,500 square kilometers (31,000 square miles) per year, or
9.5 percent per decade relative to the 1981 to 2010 average. Based on
the linear trend, since 1979, October has lost 3.58 million square
kilometers (1.38 million square miles) of sea ice, which is roughly
equivalent to five times the size of Texas or slightly more than the
country of India.

@cr-ao-index The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is a mode of climate variability that is a
measure of the relative sea level pressure difference over the north
polar region and the mid-latitudes. It has two phases. In the negative
phase, there is relative higher pressure over the Arctic and lower
pressures further south. In the positive phase, lower pressure reigns
over the Arctic with higher pressure in the mid-latitudes. A positive
AO during winter (January through March) has been associated with
stronger advection of ice across the Arctic and out through Fram
Strait (Rigor et al., 2002; Rigor and Wallace, 2004). This favors a
thinner springtime ice cover, strong summer ice loss, and a low
September minimum extent. A negative AO winter broadly favors the
opposite effect. However, as the Arctic sea ice cover has thinned, the
relationship between the winter AO and September extent seems to have
weakened and summer minimum extents can be low even with a negative
winter AO pattern (Stroeve et al., 2011).

The AO phase is also expressed in terms of weather patterns in the
mid-latitudes, particularly during winter. A negative AO tends to be
associated with a “wavier” jet stream over the United States and
Europe that can bring extreme weather to those regions. A positive AO
pattern holds the polar air mass over the Arctic, resulting in less
extreme mid-latitude winters.

So far this fall, the AO has been highly variable, with a negative
phase during the first half of October, followed by a strong positive
phase during the second half of October, but moderating toward a
neutral phase by the end of the month. Over the longer term, the
winter AO (January-February-March average, the period of the most
extensive sea ice) has trended mostly positive over the past decade;
this is true for the annual average as well, with relatively few
periods of strongly negative index values. However, the effect of this
trend is unclear. There has been little trend in summertime sea ice
extent minimums over the past 10 years.
